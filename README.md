# Online Interactive Zine Project

In this project, I combined both my interest in Computer Science and Journalism to create this interactive zine centered around Shoshana Swell and her company THIS IS MY SPACESUIT. 

I interviewed and wrote all of the content found on the website, as well as explored creative coding and interactive web design to create the final product.

Website deployed using Google Firebase (https://online-zine-aba95.web.app/).

Technologies used: React, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Google Firebase Hosting, and Atom.
