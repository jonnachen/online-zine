I always knew that the whole company would adapt to virtual workshops and that it was definitely possible, but it takes a different mindset to figure out how to make a one hour workshop helpful for anyone around the world now. In the end, when things were cut short, we had already gotten to do so much and I had gotten to meet and bring so many people together, that it was okay. I knew that this chapter could close here.</p>\n\n      </div>\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div className = \"blockquote\" id = \"quote2\">\n        <h3>\"You’re like, 'Oh, I have to deal with this first' or 'I need to be at my high when I talk to someone' — but just call.

Oh, there’s a lot of things. Oh my god. Just anything about inspiration, this is like my go-to — I could write a novel about this. Well, first you have to focus on your health and well-being. I’m a big <a href=\"headspace.com\" id=\"headspace\">Headspace</a> user. I start every morning and go to bed with Andy tucking me in — he’s the guy who speaks. So that really helps me wake up with a clear head. Another thing I try doing in the morning is a journaling exercise where you write down your daily intentions, your daily goals, and things you’re grateful for. A very quick exercise, but I think it’s a great thing to look back on. Additionally, I get a lot of inspiration by talking to others. I’m lucky I have so many creative and cool friends. I call them and am just like “What are you doing? What are you up to?” A basic conversation with them, not necessarily about projects, helps me break out of my own head. During this time, if you’re at one of your low points or you don’t feel great about your day, you don’t really think about reaching out to people. You’re like, “Oh, I have to deal with this first” or “I need to be at my high when I talk to someone” — but just call. Get the conversation flowing.</p>\n\n      </div>\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div className = \"panel\" id = \"lastsection\">\n\n      <div className = \"question question-8\">\n\n      <p>JC: As for you, how has quarantine affected your creativity personally with all this new free time?</p>\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div className = \"answer answer-8\">\n\n      <p>SS: I have a new definition of ‘busy’ these days. So when I express to my friends, “Oh, I’ve been busy”, it’s in a good way. I’ve really just tried to focus my energy towards things that could help this time and the people in this time. A lot of that is through pouring my energy into the workshops and the products that are coming out because I think it could really benefit people and empower them to still continue to create. </p>\n\n      </div>\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div id = \"ending\">\n      <p id = \"tagline\">Anyone can blast off.</p>\n\n      <p>Check out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thisismyspacesuit.com/\">http://thisismyspacesuit.com/</a>.</p>\n      <p>Follow <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thisismyspacesuit/\">@thisismyspacesuit</a> + <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/shoshanaswell/\">@shoshanaswell</a> to stay up to date on future missions.</p>\n\n      </div>\n\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
